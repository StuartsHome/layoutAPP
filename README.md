# layoutAPP
A repository to test how to structure a Python Application for readability.

Also, using different APIs that I find interesting.

Testing with unittest and mocks with unittest.mock

## Requests and JSON libraries
The Requests library provides one function:
- response.json() - Decodes json
The json library has three main functions:
- json.dump(obj, file) - Serialize obj as a JSON formatted stream to file
- json.dumps() — Serialize obj to a JSON formatted string
- json.loads() — Takes a JSON string, and converts (serializes, loads) it to a Python object.

# Source of JSON
